           <p>
            The sun is the closest star to Earth. Even at a distance of 150 million kilometers (93 million miles), its gravitational pull holds the planet in orbit. It radiates light and heat, or solar energy, which makes it possible for life to exist on Earth.</p>
            <p>
                Plants need sunlight to grow. Animals, including humans, need plants for food and the oxygen they produce. Without heat from the sun, Earth would freeze. There would be no winds, ocean currents, or clouds to transport water.</p>
                <p>Solar energy has existed as long as the sunâ€”about five billion years. While people have not been around that long, they have been using solar energy in a variety of ways for thousands of years.</p>

                        Solar cells convert sunlight directly into electricity. The amount of power generated by each cell is very low. Therefore, large numbers of cells must be grouped togethe</p> 
                    <p>Solar thermal energy can be used to heat water. First introduced in the late 1800s, the solar water heater was a big improvemen</p>

                         <p>Besides heating water, solar energy can be used to make it potable, or suitable for drinking. One method is solar disinfection (SODIS). Developed in the 1980s, SODIS involves filling plastic soda bottles with water then exposing them to sunlight for several hours. This process reduces the viruses, bacteria and protozoa in water. More than two million people in 28 developing nations use this method daily for their drinking water.</p>
